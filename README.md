### What I learned

Theres several things that I learnt from this challenge, first and foremost, that I am capable of writing decent code, styling a web page, copying to the best possible extent the style of a given web, and writing JS code. It might be something small or obvious to others, but being able to see and realize that I can write code without following a step to step guide or a video class is a big step in confidence and reassurance that I feel is so important that is should be written here. Its like taking the first solo flight (my fellow pilots will understand).
I learnt to plan the whole process and execute the step by step. 
Adjust anything that I felt needed improvement, and dont get me wrong, theres probably lots of stuff that can be imporved and updated on my code but I will get there eventually c:
Realized what things I already have incorporated and remember from previous lessons and projects and what other things were new and were practiced in this project. 
Planned the whole JS process and started writing the code onse step at a time, tunning the functions to complete each additional step. 

### Continued development

I am aware there is lots of styling that can be shortened and optimized to much less code lines. I would like to keep practicing this. 
I would also like to keep practicing the whole planning process of the project, and the planning behind the JS functions; as well as the ES6. 
In regards to the responsiveness, I would like to incorporate Bootstrap in future projects in order for the code to be neater. (I am aware on how to use Bootstrap only that I wanted to make this project without the use of it to practice my understanding and styling without relying on a framework)

## Acknowledgments

Would like to give a HUGE thanks to my partner for helping me whenever I felt stuck not only with the code but as a developer. We all know how bad imposter syndrome can be and he was by my side the whole time helping me push through those thoughts and celebrating every little win.
